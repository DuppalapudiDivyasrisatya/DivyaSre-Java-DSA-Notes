Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms notes journey
i hacve learnt today on 7th July 2025

## 1. What is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Examples:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- HashMaps

> Real Life: Bookshelf = Array (fixed order), Stack of plate= Stack (LIFO)

---

##  2. What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.

Examples:
- Searching for an item in a list
- Sorting numbers
- Calculating factorial

>  Real Life: Recipe to bake a cake is an algorithm.

---

##  3. Why are Data Structures and Algorithms Important?

- Help write efficient, optimized, and faster programs
- Used in all tech company interviews (FANG, MNCs)
- Core to solving real-world coding problems
- Makes you a better problem solver

>  DSA = Brain of software development
